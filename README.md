# xjflac-codec
Just a bit change from JFLAC library 1.5.2

This project was copied from a forked jflac project at <https://github.com/nguillaumin/jflac>, the original project site was <http://jflac.sourceforge.net/>

I need the jflac work together with java sound api, but the original project seems not be updated for a long time, so I copied this project.

I copied this project just for my own purposes, but I had no knowledge about FLAC codec nor java sound api, so this project is most likely not updated, please don't depends on this project, thanks!
